<p><em>The Dragon has obtained Cheteni&#39;s resignation letter, addressed to the d.tech board of directors, and Cheteni has given permission for The Dragon to publish it in full.</em></p>

<p>Dear Board,</p>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">I will &nbsp;be focusing more on the Designership Institute effectively in developing a truly personalized educational system that I thought Dtech would provide. Please accept my resignation effective&nbsp;<span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_2073599316"><span class="aQJ">June 23rd, 2018</span></span>.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="auto">I am effectively quitting Dtech for not only discriminatory practices towards students and staff, but an insufficient respect for deadlines, including not paying intersession teachers at all or on time. The lack of transparency and lack of the student voice makes it not a pleasant learning environment. Already, with the mass shootings we are experiencing across the country, teaching has becoming a dangerous job. The classroom has become a battleground were both teachers and students might die.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="auto">Hanan approached me and asked me to pay the salary of an intersession teacher, Brinkley Warren. It shocked me that it&#39;s been three months since he taught the course and Dtech has not paid him anything as promised. Apparently, an invoice had to be created and none of the intersession teachers including myself are aware of this. In fact, communication from administration is incredibly inconsistent and there is a disconnect between what administration is saying, what teachers think and students are left to interpret the confusion. I will NOT be paying the salary of any teacher, but I can donate to the program. It is unacceptable to ask a teacher to pay another&#39;s salary.</div>
<div dir="auto">When the executive director says that specific teachers cannot invoice the school and the school will NOT pay for an intersession classes taught by students, it worries me. Apparently, according to Ken Montgomery, Oracle must approve any payments. I thought we were an independent institution with zero influence from Oracle. Are only Oracle intersession classes actually paid? I am confused.</div>

<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">The message I am getting is that our students are not worth investing in. It saddens me that Dtech has never paid for any enrichment classes and expect teachers to cover everything and this hurts underprivileged students more. Dtech is already the lowest paying school in the entire country located in the most expensive area and that is unjustifiable to ask teachers to now use that to cover expenses that enhance the student learning experience.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="auto">In addition, I will be moving all the Artificial Intelligence and Exponential Intelligence learning tools from the Moonshots Neighbourhood (Yellow Area, Room 130) and will make these available to all students in the Moonshot labs in Newark, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. This includes the virtual reality program will move as well and I hope Dtech can invest in that for the sake of its students.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="auto">The WASC report is concerning and there is a need to have accountability as well as effective leadership. Right now we have a leadership which forces teachers to claim a particular race, sexual orientation, origin, income bracket, religion during staff meetings. Yes, this is true and every teacher can confirm this. This is disgusting and wastes valuable time hat could be used to design for extreme personalization. I choose not to participate in this kind of behavior. I also hope this does not get transferred to students as it creates a hostile learning environment and causes targeted discriminatory and retaliatory activities.</div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="auto">It pays more to work at InAndOut part time than be a full time teacher at Dtech. Please accept my resignation.</div>
